# krida
krida is an AI-powered workflow that, for any list of cities, checks today’s weather, recommends indoor or outdoor dining, selects three iconic local dishes per city, finds top-rated restaurants serving these dishes, and crafts a delightful one-day “foodie tour” narrative (breakfast, lunch, dinner) tailored to weather conditions.
